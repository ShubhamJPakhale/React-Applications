React Notes :-
----------------------------------------------------------------

1. What is Emmet?
=> It is a plugin for text editor. It covert a specific syntax in order to expand small snippets of code similar like css selectors in to full fledged HTML code.
some of emmet example :-

emmet code :- div.demo>header.header1+header.header2

emmet converted code in to HTML like below :-
    <div class="demo">
        <header class="header1"></header>
        <header class="header2"></header>
    </div>

some of emmet abrivation :-
> -> used to make child eleme
+ -> used to make main elements in HTML
. -> used to add class to elements
# -> used to add id to elements
--------------------------------------------------------

2. What is diffenence between library and framework ?
=> Library : It provides developer with predefined functions and calsses to make their work easier and boost the development process.
framework : It is like the foundation upon which developers build applications for specific platforms.

Regarding incersion of control :
in library, you can control the flow of your application and call the library functions
while in framework, framework controls the flow and calls your codes.
------------------------------------------------------------

3. What is the CDN? Why do we use it?
=> content delivery nework (CDN) is refers to a geographically distributed group of servers which work together to provide fase delivery of internet content.
It allows for the quick transfer of assets for loading internet content including HTML pages, javascript files and stylesheets, images and videos.

Benefits of using the CDN :-
1. Improve the performance of website load times
2. reduce bandwidth costs
3. increasing content availability and redundancy
4. Improve website sequrity.
---------------------------------------------------------------

4. Why React is known as React?
=> React is a javascript library for creating user interface for websites and applications.
Developed by facebook developer Jordan Walke in 2011. React makes it painless to create interactive UI's. Design simple views for each 
state in your application and react will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes. Declarative 
views make your code more predictable and easier to debug.

5.  What is crossorigin in script tag ?
=> Cross-origin attribute valid on the audio, image, link, script and video elements. provides support for cross-origin resource sharing. 
It define how the element handles cross-origin requests, therby enabling the configuration of CORS requests for the element's fetched data.
It specifies that CORS is supported when loading an external script file from a third party server or domain. 
 possible values of cross-origin attribute are:
 1. anonymous (same origin) - so here if destination is not same then data is not shared across
 2. user-credentials (include) - user credentials are always included.
 3. "" - it is same as anonymous.
-------------------------

6. Difference between React and ReactDOm?
=> React - It is a javascript library which used to building better user interfaces.
ReactDOM - It is complimentary library which glues react to the browser DOM. 

Whenever we use components, classes, elements etc. we are using React and whenever we use methods like render() or findDOMNode() we are using ReactDOM.
----------------------------------------------------------------

7. What is diffenences between react.development.js and react.production.js files via CDN?
=> react.development.js is in readable format code to easily readable for developers. 
while in react.production.js is in minified version and size of file is very less.

----------------------------------------------------------------

8. Difference between defer and async
=> Both async and defer in Script tags are used to optimize the loading time of websites. 
Without these attributes, the browser pauses HTML parsing when it encounters the script tag and sends Network request for the script files. 
When the script files are received, it executes the script files and only then it would continue with HTML parsing.
Async is suitable when the application requires scripts that need not be executed in a specific order(for example, some third party scripts). 
However, async does not guarantee the order in which script files are executed. 
If the application has many script files and one script file depends on the execution of the other scripts, then using async may result in errors.

defer - When the Script has defer attribute, the browser sends the network request for the script files without pausing HTML parsing. 
Only arter the HTML is completely parsed, the browser executes the scripts. Unlike async, the browser can execute the scripts in which they are required by the app.
Defer is suitable if the application has script files that needs to be executed in a specific order.
